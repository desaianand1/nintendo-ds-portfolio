# Nintendo DS Lite Portfolio - Active Context

## Current Focus

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and 3D Implementation

We are currently in the initial phase of development, focusing on:

1. Project Structure Setup
   - ‚úÖ Basic SvelteKit project configuration
   - ‚úÖ TypeScript and tooling setup
   - ‚úÖ 3D rendering pipeline setup
   - üîÑ Component architecture implementation

2. 3D Model Integration
   - ‚úÖ Model pipeline configuration
   - ‚úÖ Initial model loading
   - üîÑ Animation system setup
   - ‚è≥ Interaction system implementation

3. Core Components
   - üîÑ Scene.svelte development
   - üîÑ DSLite.svelte implementation
   - ‚è≥ Controls.svelte creation
   - ‚è≥ Basic UI components

## Recent Changes

### Model Pipeline

- Implemented model optimization pipeline using @threlte/gltf
- Successfully loaded and rendered initial DS Lite model
- Configured basic scene lighting and camera setup

### Component Architecture

- Created base Scene.svelte component
- Started implementation of DSLite.svelte
- Established core state management patterns

## Active Decisions

### Animation System

Currently evaluating two approaches:

1. Using built-in Three.js animation system
   - Pros: Direct integration with model
   - Cons: Less control over animation states

2. Custom animation controller
   - Pros: More control, better state management
   - Cons: More complex implementation

Decision Pending: Need to test both approaches with actual model animations

### Screen Overlay System

Considering implementation approaches:

1. Pure CSS positioning
   - Pros: Simple, performant
   - Cons: May break during complex camera movements

2. 3D to 2D projection
   - Pros: Accurate positioning
   - Cons: More complex, potential performance impact

Current Lean: 3D to 2D projection for accuracy

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Complete DSLite.svelte component
   - Implement basic model rendering
   - Setup animation system
   - Add interaction points

2. Develop Controls.svelte
   - Camera controls implementation
   - Interaction ray casting
   - Event handling system

3. Begin UI Components
   - Screen overlay positioning system
   - Basic DS menu structure
   - Portfolio section templates

### Upcoming Challenges

1. Screen Position Tracking
   - Need to ensure accurate HTML overlay positioning
   - Must handle all camera angles and movements
   - Performance optimization required

2. Animation State Management
   - Complex state machine for DS interactions
   - Smooth transitions between states
   - Event handling and propagation

3. Performance Optimization
   - Model optimization
   - Render pipeline efficiency
   - State management overhead

## Technical Debt

### Known Issues

1. Model Loading
   - Need to implement proper loading states
   - Error handling improvements required
   - Asset preloading strategy needed

2. Type Definitions
   - Some component props need better typing
   - Event type definitions incomplete
   - State management type improvements needed

### Optimization Opportunities

1. Asset Loading
   - Implement progressive loading
   - Add loading indicators
   - Optimize initial bundle size

2. Performance
   - Implement render batching
   - Add level of detail system
   - Optimize state updates

## Questions to Resolve

1. Animation System
   - Which approach provides better control?
   - How to handle complex state transitions?
   - Performance implications?

2. Screen Overlay
   - Best method for position tracking?
   - How to handle edge cases?
   - Performance vs accuracy trade-offs?

3. State Management
   - Current structure scalability?
   - Performance implications?
   - Type safety improvements?

## Current Blockers

None currently identified. Development is proceeding according to plan.

## Notes

- Keep monitoring performance as components are added
- Document all animation states and transitions
- Consider accessibility early in development
- Regular testing across different devices/browsers

This active context will be updated as development progresses and new challenges or decisions arise.
